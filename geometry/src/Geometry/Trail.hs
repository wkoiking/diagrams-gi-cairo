-- $trails
--
-- A /trail/ is either a /line/ or a /loop/.
--
-- * A 'Line' (think "train line", not "straight line") is a path
--   through space that may end in a different place than where it
--   started. (A line may happen to end in the same place that it
--   starts but this would just be a coincidence.)  Lines are not
--   closed and hence they are never filled, even if they happen to
--   start and end at the same place.
--
-- * A 'Loop' is a closed path through space which ends in the same
--   place it starts, and hence can be filled (at least in 2D; in
--   higher dimensions filling a loop probably does not make sense).
--
-- * The 'Trail' type is simply the sum of 'Line' and 'Loop', i.e.
--   it is either one or the other.
--
-- Trails do not have an absolute location, i.e. they are
-- /translationally invariant/.  If you want a concretely positioned
-- trail, use the 'Located' wrapper.

-- $prim
-- These functions directly construct a line or loop from a list of
-- segments.  They can occasionally be useful if you want to directly
-- construct some segments (/e.g./ using a function like 'bezier3'),
-- but typically you would use one of the @fromXXX@ functions in the
-- next section instead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The line type
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | A 'Line' (think "train line", not "straight line") is a
--   translationally invariant path through space.  Lines are not
--   closed and hence they are never filled, even if they happen to
--   start and end at the same place.
--
--   To construct a 'Line', use 'fromVertices', 'fromOffsets', ('~~'),
--   'fromSegments', or any of the other @from...@ functions in this
--   module.  The 'Semigroup' (and 'Monoid') instance can be used to
--   construct bigger 'Line's out of smaller ones by concatenation.
--
--   To turn a 'Line' into a 'Loop', use 'closeLine' or 'glueLine'; to
--   turn a 'Line' into a 'Trail', use 'wrapLine'.  More generally,
--   use 'fromLine' to turn a 'Line' into any instance of 'FromTrail'.
--
--   To reverse a 'Line', use 'reversing'.
--
--   Lines are represented as a sequence of 'Segment's, concatenated
--   end to end, together with the cached offset vector from the start
--   of the line to the end.

-- [folds-over-trails]
--
-- Many of the folds over trails involve keeping the current position
-- and some state. To make sure everything's strict we use a Pair.
-- However this is still not ideal because it involves boxing and
-- unboxing the position and state at every step, even with a
-- SPECIALISE.
--
-- Normally GHC is smart enough to turn strict accumulators into unboxed
-- tuples; however, this isn't possible in our case because the
-- definition of foldl' for Data.Seq isn't inlined. This is for the best
-- because the definition is quite large, leading to slow compile times and
-- masses of generated core for little performance benefit.
--
-- So for the important calculations (envelope, crossings) we make a
-- custom unpacked version of Pair for each specialisation and use RULES
-- to implement them. It's a bit more boilerplate but gives a 80-20%
-- speed improvement so the extra code is worth it.
